The unbiased model shows better performance across nearly all metrics compared to the biased model, especially for the majority class (Class 1), with improved precision, recall, and F1-score. The minority class (Class 0) also sees slight improvements in precision and F1-score, though recall stays about the same. These gains in fairness and accuracy reflect a more balanced and effective model, making the unbiased model more favorable for deployment.
