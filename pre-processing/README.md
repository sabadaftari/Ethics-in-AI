Insights: The debiased model shows a decrease in accuracy compared to the biased model. While it performs better in terms of recall for the negative class (0), it struggles with precision and recall for the positive class (1). This indicates that while debiasing has improved some aspects of the model's fairness, it may have negatively impacted its overall performance.

Comparison of the Models
Accuracy: The biased model outperforms the debiased model with 72% accuracy compared to 67%.
Positive Class Performance: The biased model has better precision and recall for the positive class (1), indicating it is more reliable in predicting this class.
Negative Class Performance: The debiased model has better recall for the negative class (0), suggesting it is more inclusive of this class, though at the expense of overall accuracy.
Bias Mitigation: The efforts to debias the model have somewhat decreased its performance, indicating a potential trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Messaging Technique: Helped maintain performance for class 1 while allowing for a slight improvement in precision for class 0. However, it slightly decreased recall for class 0, indicating that while the method can be effective in reducing bias, it can also introduce trade-offs in predictive performance.
